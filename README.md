# BlackPWA

Is this the simplest PWA (Progressive Web App) ever? It's just a black browser tab / window / screen, but its simplicity offers diverse potential uses, from enhancing focus to serving as a privacy screen. Despite its straightforward appearance, BlackPWA's utility extends far beyond initial expectations.
